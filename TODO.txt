Short term:
- Include key to explain home/away colouring on front page - currently vague.
- Edit styling to better render images on mobile.
- Edit form styling. Read more on Django forms and widgets.
- Add README

Long term:
- Set up ability for additional users.
- Build embeded list of stadia with a form to add additional (So that I can do is outside of /admin)
- Build form to add additional teams from outside NWCFL (Again so it can be done outside of /admin but won't come up very often)

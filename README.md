# [Watching West](https://yanader.pythonanywhere.com/watchingwest/)

## Description

An online record, built with Django and SQLite, of every time I go to watch West Didsbury & Chorlton AFC. I'm not much of a copy-writer or photographer but this is mostly for personal reference.

This was my first built and deployed project and, although I learned a lot during construction, there is a lot wrong with it and in the medium term I plan to rebuild it as a Spring backend. I _may_ learn react for the frontend.

#### Home

A complete list of every game I've been to along with opposition, competition and date. Themeing based on whether the fixture was home or away.

#### Create Entry

A simple web form used to make a new entry. Password protected and in need of an overhaul.

### Most Seen

Details of which opposition I've seen play the most. filterable by home and away.

### Random Entry

Displays a random entry.

### Future Inclusions

The only maintenance to be carried out is periodically updating the list of potential opponents in the database so entries can continue to be logged. Any other changes will be part of a complete rebuild.
